redux1 branch:to practice  the playlist from codeevolution this branch has been created


subscribe method:this method is responsible to register listener . and subscribe method is called everytime when the state is changed .Subscribe accepts a function as it's argument.


note 1:

by using reducer action creator we could change the state.

by using bindaction we created double reducer and could create different seperate states.

by using thunk middleware based on api response we could call other action creator.

what thunk middleware gave us that let us return a function which is not possible(possible is returning an object.), possible but not easily. it gives more readability, seperation of concerns.
